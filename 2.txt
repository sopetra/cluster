Just Chepkemei and Radcliffe were left in contention as the race came into the final few miles.But it was Radcliffe who managed to dredge up a final sprint to see off Chepkemei in the closest finish in the race's history and in the process make a huge step in erasing the disappointment she suffered in Athens.  The Kenyan put in several bursts of speed to throw off Radcliffe but the Briton managed to hang in.Radcliffe decided only recently to run in the race and many had doubted whether she had sufficiently recovered from her Olympic ordeal just 11 weeks ago."It's a good way to end the year," she said.
Paula Radcliffe has called for all athletes found guilty on drugs charges to be treated as criminals."Often, when an athlete puts in a good performance, they are subjected to suspicions and innuendoes instead of praise.Radcliffe's comments come at a time when several American sports stars are under suspicion of steroid use."This means that often athletes do not know if they are competing on a level playing field, if their hard work and sacrifice is being trumped by an easier scientific route.
"My whole belief about Victor is that he was selling a product," White said in the LA Times.White said Conte at first told her the substance was flaxseed oil, only to change his story later.Conte faces a federal trial next year on charges of distributing steroids and tax evasion, and White said at first he tried to cover up what he was doing."I have no clue what it's going to take to change that," said White.White was introduced to Conte through her coach Remy Korchemy, who is also a defendant in the Balco case."He's the one who told me that it wasn't what he said it was," White said in the San Francisco Chronicle.
Kenteris and Thanou also face criminal charges in Greece for allegedly faking the motorcycle accident.Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou will fight the provisional two-year bans imposed on them by the IAAF at an independent tribunal this weekend.The sprint duo face charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to a drugs test.The panel will also decide on the two-year ban imposed on the athletes' controversial coach Christos Tzekos by the IAAF.But there has been speculation that the charges could be dropped.They also missed tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens before the Games.Eight criminal charges have been laid against the sprinters as well as Tzekos, an eyewitness to the accident and hospital officials.Kenteris, the 2000 Olympic 200m champion, and Thanou, the women's 100m silver medallist from the same Games in Sydney, quit the Olympics on 18 August after failing to give samples on the eve of the opening ceremony.
"Mr Conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television, while Marion Jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.Marion Jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against Balco boss Victor Conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.Jones, who is under investigation for steroid use by the US Anti-Doping Agency, has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the Balco scandal, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed.After the ABC television program earlier this month, Jones' lawyer Richard Nicholls said: "Marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs."Victor Conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment, while Marion Jones is one of America's most decorated female athletes.But Davies stressed it would be up to the American authorities to decide whether they will take action against Jones in light of Conte's television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely.Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a US television programme."Mr Conte is simply not credible.We challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that Marion Jones passed."Communications director Nick Davies said the IAAF would seek to contact Conte "for further information".
Collins has played rugby at regional level, was captain of the Great Britain American Football team, and competed at national level in judo and karate.Collins said: "It's a great challenge.UK Athletics has ended its search for a new performance director by appointing psychologist Dave Collins.Collins, who worked with the British teams at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, takes over from Max Jones.He has specialised in helping competitors fulfil their potential through psychology and has worked with the Great Britain women's curling team, who won gold at the 2002 Winter Olympics.The appointment of a new performance director was one of the main recommendations in Sir Andrew Foster's review of the sport, which was published in May.It was commissioned by UK Sport and Sport England, which wanted UK Athletics to justify funding of more than Â£40m from the Government following the failure to hang on to the 2005 World Championships, which are now being held in Helsinki."The appointment of David Collins, with his strong mix of leadership skills and managerial experience, is testament to the professional and detailed recruitment process," he said.He is currently professor of physical education and sport performance at Edinburgh University, where he helps competitors across many sports, including rugby, athletics, judo and football.
Kenteris and Thanou already face a criminal trial after being charged with avoiding a drug test on the eve of the Athens Olympics and then faking a motorcyle crash.The Greek pair were charged after missing a series of routine drugs tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens.Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou are yet to respond to doping charges from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).But Kenteris and Thanou then went on to skip tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago, when they decided to fly back to Greece early.Their former coach Christos Tzekos has also been charged with distributing banned substances.Then just before the Olympics, the pair dramatically missed another test in Athens and withdrew from the Games.
A US judge has set a preliminary trial date for the Balco steroid distribution case which has rocked athletics.The judge said that she may conduct hearings in January into whether federal agents illegally searched the Balco headquarters and wrongfully obtained statements from the company's founder Victor Conte and its vice-president James Valente.The company has been accused by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) of being the source of the banned steroid THG and modafinil.And she set a March date for the case of the four men accused of distributing illegal performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes to be heard.The USADA claims that 10 athletes have received sanctions for testing positive for THG and modafinil.US district court judge Susan Ilston rejected an attempt by the defence team to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in San Francisco.
For the first time, Claxton has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles - which could explain her leap in form.Claxton has won the national 60m hurdles title for the past three years but has struggled to translate her domestic success to the international stage.British hurdler Sarah Claxton is confident she can win her first major medal at next month's European Indoor Championships in Madrid.Claxton will see if her new training regime pays dividends at the European Indoors which take place on 5-6 March."I am quite confident," said Claxton.
Greek sprinter Kostas Kenteris has denied claims that he faked a motorbike crash to avoid a doping test days before the start of the Olympics.Kenteris insisted: "The accident happened.Kenteris, speaking on Greece's Alter Television station, also claimed that he asked to be tested for banned substances in hospital after the crash.But Kenteris has continually protested his innocence - and on Sunday blamed Greek Olympic Committee officials and his former coach Christos Tzekos for failing to inform him of the test.Kenteris, a Greek hero after winning gold in the 200m at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, also confirmed that he was due to light the flame at the Athens opening ceremony.Kenteris and fellow sprinter Katerina Thanou are set to learn if they will face criminal charges this week.
The participation of O'Sullivan, currentily training at her base in Australia, would boost the Ireland team who won the bronze three years agio.O'Sullivan will also take part in the Bupa Great Ireland Run on 9 April in Dublin.O'Sullivan is at present preparing for the London marathon on 17 April.
I think when I was coming up I would say there was me and Ato (Boldon) in the young crowd," Greene said.But Greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals."In my semi-final race, I should have won the race but I was conserving energy.Greene was also denied Olympic gold in the 4x100m men's relay when he could not catch Britain's Mark Lewis-Francis on the final leg.I lost because of the things I did," said Greene, who races in Birmingham on Friday.It was my mistake."I believe if I was in the middle of the race I would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me.""That's when Francis Obikwelu came up and I took third because I didn't know he was there.Maurice Greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his Olympic 100m title in Athens by winning a fourth World Championship crown this summer."I believe that's what put me in lane seven in the final and, while I was in lane seven, I couldn't feel anything in the race.
"I am very happy to see you all, members of the athletics family, respond positively to the IAAF call to sit together and discuss what more we can do in the fight against doping," said Diack.The two task forces will report back to the IAAF Council, at its April meeting in Qatar."Nothing was decided to change things - it was more to have a forum of the stakeholders allowing them to express themselves," said an IAAF spokesman.The IAAF - athletics' world governing body - has met anti-doping officials, coaches and athletes to co-ordinate the fight against drugs in sport.
Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba set a new world record in winning the women's 5,000m at the Boston Indoor Games.The plan was to go with 500m to go no matter what, but when Bekele made the mistake that was it.Dibaba won in 14 minutes 32.93 seconds to erase the previous world indoor mark of 14:39.29 set by another Ethiopian, Berhane Adera, in Stuttgart last year.Ireland's Alistair Cragg won in 7:39.89 as Bekele battled to second in 7:41.42.
In the men's 60m, former Olympic 100m champion Maurice Greene could only finish second to Leonard Scott.It was the Russian's 12th world record of her career and came just a few days after she cleared 4.88m at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham.It was Greene's second consecutive defeat at the hands of his fellow American, who also won in Birmingham last week.
Carroll will be facing stiff competition from Australian Craig Mottram, winner in Dublin for the last two years.Mark Carroll, Irish record holder at 3km, 5km and 10km, will make his debut in the mass participation 10km race.The 35-year-old was beaten into fourth at last year's event, having won it a year earlier.
Moore said Hansen may be able to return to sprinting and long jumping sooner, but there is no short-term prospect of her being involved again in her specialist event.Moore said he is confident Hansen can make it back to top-level competition, though it is unclear if that will be in time for the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne next March, when she will be 34."There was a problem with the wound healing and it set back her rehabilitation by about two months, but that has been solved and we can push ahead now," he said.British triple jumper Ashia Hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury, according to reports.
At the same meeting,  finished third in 7.27 seconds in a high-class women's 60m.Gardener clocked 6.56 seconds to equal the meeting record and finished well ahead of Germany's Marc Blume, who crossed the line in 6.67 secs.The world indoor champion said: "I got to the airport and my stomach was upset and I was vomiting.Britain's Jason Gardener shook off an upset stomach to win the 60m at Sunday's Leipzig International meeting.Olympic bronze heptathlon medallist  made a low-key return to action at an indoor meeting in Birmingham.Promising 60m hurdler  clocked a new UK record of 7.98 seconds at a meeting in Norway.The event was won by European medal favourite Christine Arron of France while Belgium rival Kim Gevaert was second., who broke onto the international scene at the Olympic Games last season, set an indoor personal best of 16.50m in the triple jump at a meeting in Ghent.Germany's Alexander Kosenkow won the race in 21.07 secs with Dutchman Patrick van Balkom second in 21.58 secs.
Collins ran in Birmingham at the 2003 World Indoor Championships.Sydney Olympic 100m champion and world indoor record holder Maurice Greene and Athens Olympic 100m silver medallist Francis Obikwelu will also take part."Jason Gardener and Mark Lewis-Francis are Olympic gold medallists now and I'm sure they'll be aiming to win in front of their home supporters.Collins was sixth in the Olympic final in Athens but is hoping for a better result at the World Championships in Finland this summer.World and Commonwealth 100m champion Kim Collins will compete in the 60m at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham on 18 February.
British team member Hayley Yelling said the team would understand if Radcliffe opted out of the event."It would be fantastic to have Paula in the team," said the European cross-country champion."There is no question that Paula would be a huge asset to the GB team," said Zara Hyde Peters of UK Athletics.Radcliffe was world cross-country champion in 2001 and 2002 but missed last year's event because of injury.Paula Radcliffe has been granted extra time to decide whether to compete in the World Cross-Country Championships.
World outdoor triple jump record holder and BBC pundit Jonathan Edwards believes Phillips Idowu can take gold at the European Indoor Championships.Idowu landed 17.30m at the British trials in Sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings."It's all down to him, but if he jumps as well as he did in Sheffield he could win the gold medal," said Edwards.Edwards himself kept Idowu off top spot at the Manchester Games.The qualifying round of the men's triple jump in Madrid takes place on Friday with the final scheduled for Saturday.
Masai missed Kenya's world cross country trials because of an ankle problem but AK insisted it would take disciplinary action unless she could prove she was really injured.The Kenyan coaching team will now decide whether Chepkemei can be included in the team for this month's world cross country championships.Kenya's athletics body has reversed a ban on marathon runner Susan Chepkemei after she made an official apology.AK also dropped its harsh stance on three-time world cross country 4km champion Edith Masai.Chepkemei has given a reason for her absence," said AK chief Isaiah Kiplagat."I will be disappointed if I am not given a chance to compete at the world cross country championships."AK had insisted it was making an example of Chepkemei by banning her from competition until the end of 2005.
UK Athletics has agreed a new deal with adidas to supply Great Britain squads of all ages with their kit for the next four years.This week, UK Athletics also agreed a four-year deal with energy drink company, Red Bull, who will be supplying the product to athletics at major domestic meetings and in high performance centres.UK Athletics chief David Moorcroft said: "The Athens experience can now be extended to more major championships.
Greek athletics' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou for missing doping tests.The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry."I am confident and optimistic," Thanou had said at the time.The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests.The pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year's Athens Olympics.
Lester is better known for his work with 400m runners Roger Black and Mark Richardson in the past but under his guidance McIlroy has secured five wins this indoor season.McIlroy now lives in Windsor and feels his career has been transformed by the no-nonsense leadership style of former Army sergeant Lester.He said: "I've been much more focused this year about my career and having such a good team around me has been very important."I believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in Sheffield, I can run my race from the front, back or middle," said McIlroy.Northern Ireland man James McIlroy is confident he can win his first major title at this weekend's Spar European Indoor Championships in Madrid.The rest of my time has seen me just concentrating on rebuilding my career.""That ambition has meant that I've had only two nights out since last August.New coach Tony Lester has helped get McIlroy's career back on track."That was my last decent year," said McIlroy, who temporarily retired last August before returning to the sport under Lester's shrewd guidance.
Kostas Kenteris' lawyer has called for the doping charges against the Greek sprinter to be dropped.Kenteris and compatriot Katerina Thanou were given provisional suspensions in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics.Kenteris and Thanou withdrew from the Athens Olympics last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony.The lawyer added that he has proof the authorities "knew" Kenteris was in Germany at the time he was alleged to have missed a test in Chicago.Gregory Ioannidis has submitted new evidence to a Greek athletics tribunal which he claims proves the former Olympic champion has no case to answer.
Kenyan Bernard Lagat missed out on the world record by 1.45secs as he ran the third quickest indoor mile ever to beat Canada's Nate Brannen by almost 10secs.The Olympic silver medallist's time of three minutes 49.89secs was inferior only to the 1997 world record of Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj and former world record holder Eamonn Coghlan of Ireland's 3:49.78.World indoor 60m hurdles champion  also won, improving his season-leading time to 7.51secs.Only Michael Johnson has gone quicker, setting the world record of 44.63secs in 1995 and running 44.66secs in 1996.Olympic 200m gold medallist  of Jamaica ran the fastest women's 60m in the world this year as she equalled her personal best of 7.09secs.
London Marathon organisers are hoping that banned athlete Susan Chepkemei will still take part in this year's race on 17 April.Chepkemei however took part and finished third in last Sunday's world best 10K race in Puerto Rico.The 29-year-old has finished second to Paula Radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 London races as well as in November's New York City marathon.
World outdoor triple jump record holder and BBC pundit Jonathan Edwards believes Phillips Idowu can take gold at the European Indoor Championships.Idowu landed 17.30m at the British trials in Sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings."It's all down to him, but if he jumps as well as he did in Sheffield he could win the gold medal," said Edwards.Edwards himself kept Idowu off top spot at the Manchester Games.The qualifying round of the men's triple jump in Madrid takes place on Friday with the final scheduled for Saturday.
Athletics Kenya (AK) issued the ban after Chepkemei failed to turn up for a cross country training camp in Embu.Global Sports Communications, Chepkemei's management company, said she had wanted to run in the World Cross Country Championships in March.KA has also threatened three-time women's short-course champion Edith Masai with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true.But the ban will prevent the two-time world half-marathon silver medallist from challenging Radcliffe at this year's London event in April.Kenya's athletics body has suspended two-time London Marathon runner-up Susan Chepkemei from all competition until the end of the year."We have banned her from all local and international competitions," said AK chief Isaiah Kiplagat.
I was nervous about whether I would actually be able to get round."It was all about winning in front of my home crowd.Holmes hit the front just before the bell in front of a sell-out crowd in Glasgow and cruised to victory in a time of four minutes 14.74 seconds."It was nice to get that out of the way.The Olympic 800m and 1500m champion's time was inside the qualifying mark for the European Indoor Championships in Madrid in March.Britain's Kelly Holmes marked her first appearance on home soil since winning double Olympic gold with 1500m victory at the Norwich Union International.
Susan Chepkemei has decided she is fit enough to run in next month's Great Edinburgh International Cross Country.Recently-crowned European cross country champion Briton Hayley Yelling also competes in Edinburgh on 15 January, as does in-form Scot Kathy Butler.Chepkemei, who won the six kilometre event three years ago when it was staged in Newcastle, endured an epic battle with Radcliffe in the Big Apple until the Briton outsprinted her in the final 400m.
Sprinter Michelle Collins has lodged an appeal against her eight-year doping ban with the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).The San Francisco-based Balco laboratory is at the centre of the scandal which has rocked the sport.Collins was suspended by the US Anti-Doping Agency based on patterns observed in her blood and urine tests as well as evidence in the Balco investigation.The 33-year-old received the ban last month as a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal.
Yiannis Papadoyiannakis, who was head of the Greek Olympic team at the Athens Games last year, also testified at the tribunal, along with other Greek sports officials and athletes.The five-member tribunal, assembled by the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics, is also examining allegations that Kenteris and Thanou avoided tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago before the Games.They were given provisional suspensions by athletics' ruling body the IAAF in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics.Tzekos was also banned for two years by the IAAF.Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have appeared before an independent tribunal which will decide if their bans should stand.All three, who have repeatedly denied the allegations, have also been charged by a Greek prosecutor and face trial for doping-related charges."There is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted."But Kenteris' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis told BBC Sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing."I believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution," said Papadoyiannakis.
Double Olympic champion Hicham El Guerrouj is set to make a rare appearance at the World Cross Country Championships in France."I haven't quite decided what events I will compete in prior to London but the World Cross Country is an event which is also special to me and is a definite possibility," said the two-time champion.El Guerrouj could meet Bekele in March as the Ethiopian is the defending world cross country champion over both the long and short courses.- Britain's Paula Radcliffe has also not ruled out competing in the World Cross Country Championships.But the Moroccan, who has not raced over cross country for 15 years, will not decide until two weeks before the event which starts on 19 March.And he is aiming to break 10,000m Olympic champion Kenenisa Bekele's 5,000m and 10,000m world records.
Double Olympic champion Kelly Holmes has been voted European Athletics (EAA) woman athlete of 2004 in the governing body's annual poll.Her gutsy victory in the 800m also earned her the International Association of Athletics Federations' award for the best women's performance in the world for 2004.And she scooped two awards at the British Athletics Writers' Association annual dinner in October.The Briton, made a dame in the New Year Honours List for taking 800m and 1,500m gold, won vital votes from the public, press and EAA member federations.
"To go to Athens and finally get the gold I've been trying to get for 24 years was a big relief," said Campbell.Campbell, who won Olympic 4x100m relay gold, had been unsure about his future.Campbell was part of the British quartet who shocked the Americans to win relay gold in Athens in August.The 31-year-old, who won Olympic 200m silver in Sydney in 2000, said during the Games that a hamstring injury had stopped him from running at his best."I've started back and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.He was criticised at the time by former Olympic champion Michael Johnson, who cast doubt on Campbell's injury claims.Campbell set his 100m personal best of 10.04secs when he won the European title in Budapest in 1998.
Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva has confirmed she will take part in the 2005 Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham on 18 February.Isinbayeva, 22, has set 10 world records in the pole vault, three of which have come on British soil.The pair had a thrilling battle in Athens which ended with Isinbayeva finally jumping a world record of 4.91m to claim the gold medal.I always seem to break records there," said Isinbayeva.
At the start of the year, several Northern Ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the Games but come August, an out-of-form and injured Paul Brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province.Sonia O'Sullivan's Olympic farewell apart, there was little to stir the emotions of Irish athletics watchers.Once the track and field action began in Athens, a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although Alistair Cragg's performance in being the only athlete from a European nation to qualify for the 5,000m final did offer hope for the future.But come late August, a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in Athens told us of the true strength of Irish athletics - or to be more accurate, the lack of it.At least Sonia managed to make it to Athens.Amazingly, she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the Flora Lite 5K road race in London and while her major championship days may be over, it's unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition.As it happened, she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner Meseret Defar.800m hope McIlroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the British trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane.The injury-plagued Turnbull gamely travelled round Europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best he could achieve, after missing several months training during the previous winter.2004 won't be remembered as one of Irish athletics' great years.Less than a week before the Olympics, the sport was rocked by news that 10,000m hope Cathal Lombard had tested for the banned substance EPO.James McIlroy, Gareth Turnbull, Zoe Brown and Paul McKee all had to be content with watching the Athens action on their television screens.
"I had intended to race but I'm running like a goon," said Walker.Walker had hoped to compete in the New Year Sprint which is staged at Musselburgh Racecourse near Edinburgh on Tuesday and Wednesday.He told the Herald newspaper: "I'm not in great shape, after missing about a month of training.Former European 200m champion Dougie Walker is to retire from athletics after a series of six operations left him struggling for fitness.
Olympic 10,000m champion Kenenisa Bekele is determined to add the world indoor two mile record at February's Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham.And Bekele is no stranger to overhauling world marks at the National Indoor Arena.The Ethiopian broke the world indoor 5,000m record on his debut at the meeting last year."And aiming for the two mile world record in Birmingham is the next of those targets."Compatriots Mulugeta Wondimu, Abiyote Abate and Markos Geneti, the world indoor bronze medallist over 3000m, will race against Bekele on 18 February.
"There will be a final right of appeal from the decision of the Greek Federation to the Court of Arbitration for Sport," the IAAF said.Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have been suspended after failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics.Wednesday's statement said the Greek Federation (SEGAS) would convene a disciplinary hearing for the trio to determine whether there had been doping violations.Kenteris, the 2000 Olympic 200m champion, and Thanou, the women's 100m silver medallist from the same Games in Sydney, also face a criminal hearing in Greece over the missed tests.They face two-year bans if found guilty by the Greek Athletics Federation.Athletics' ruling body the IAAF said explanations from the pair and their former coach as to why they missed the tests were "unacceptable".
And it was a bit of a rarity for me too because I genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out.Dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise.It was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her Athens story.One of my favourite Olympic moments was Kelly's success in the 800m.Winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality.So to have an Australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special.The victory for the British men's 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the Games.That was her heart and not her head reacting.He was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles.And one of the positive things to come out of Balco is people are starting to blow the whistle.It was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, Paula showed real "bouncebackability".The thing is if we don't have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn't look good for the Beijing Olympics and beyond.What happened to Paula in Athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well.The only individual men's finalist on the track was Michael East in the 1500m.Dani Barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for Team GB.Paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.The lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake.Well, it's goodbye to another Olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in Athens.And that's where things begin to look even gloomier for British athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in Italy.
Sprinter Michelle Collins has received an eight-year ban for doping offences after a hearing at the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)."The USADA has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Collins took EPO, the testosterone/epitestosterone cream and THG," said a CAS statement.Collins' ban is a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal.USADA chief executive officer Terry Madden said the action taken against Collins was further proof of that.The USADA has built its cases on verbal evidence given to the federal investigation into Balco rather than test results.So far a total of 13 athletes have been sanctioned for violations involving drugs associated with the Balco doping scandal.The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) decided to press charges against Collins in the summer.
Jones, who says she is innocent, could lose all her Olympic medals after Conte said he gave her performance-enhancing drugs before the Sydney Olympics.The Sydney Olympics ended more than four years ago, but World Anti-Doping Agency chief Dick Pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now.An investigation into doping claims against Marion Jones has been opened by the International Olympic Committee."Victor Conte's allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward," she said.
And a lot of people were wondering what would happen if Paula was forced to drop out of this race, as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in Athens.And if she lost, people would say her career was over.I was speaking to Paula in the lead-up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no-win situation.If Paula's last experience of the year had been Athens, it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism.It was a strong field, with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning.Now Paula will take part in the Run London 10km race in London at the end of the year, have a well-earned rest over Christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism.Even if she'd lost this race, there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it.But that was never on the cards.She thought that if she won, people would say "why couldn't she do that in Athens?"
Their focus has to be on being the best in the world and not just on being the top British sprinter."Former Olympic champion Michael Johnson has accused Britain's top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition."At the moment, the biggest factor on the mind of British sprinters is to be number one in Britain," the world 200m and 400m record holder told Five Live."The only time you see British sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is a debate as to which one is better than the other," he claimed.And the American remains highly critical of aspects of British sprinting.Speaking at an elite coaches' conference in Birmingham, Johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in Britain, it had not necessarily reaped the rewards.
"If she is found guilty she should be stripped of all her medals and banned for two years," said Pound.World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chief Dick Pound says Marion Jones should be stripped of all her medals if found guilty of taking banned substances.Asked if there was a timescale as to what medals could be taken, Pound said: "That is not an issue at all."Jones, who won five medals at the 2000 Olympics, denies using drugs and says she will take legal action over Conte's allegations.
Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe.And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York.Radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon.Radcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as "impulsive" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals."Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens."It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again," said Yelling, herself a marathon runner.Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York.For much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose."She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'" Yelling told BBC Sport."You can't change history," warned Richards.Back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m.BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race."There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'" Richards told BBC Sport.And Yelling says: "I think this will probably make Paula."Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption.Radcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time.
"It is such a great honour to win the Jesse Owens Award," said Gatlin.Established in 1981, the Jesse Owens Awards - named in honour of the late Olympic great who won four gold medals at the 1936 Berlin Games - are presented annually to the outstanding US male and female track and field performers.American Olympic stars Justin Gatlin and Joanna Hayes have been named the winners of the 2004 Jesse Owens Awards, USA Track & Field's (USATF) top honour."It is one of the biggest honours in track and field and it is a great end to a great year. "
Women will be employed in Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry for the first time this year, Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal has been reported as saying.The newspaper said many Saudi women found his explanation "a pitiful excuse for not employing women"."I am proud to mention here that this year we shall have women working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the first time.""Our educational reforms have created a new generation of highly-educated and professionally trained Saudi women who are acquiring their rightful position in Saudi society," Arab News quoted Prince Saud as saying.
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that allowing huge US budget deficits to continue could have "severe" consequences.He also urged Congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the US heading further into the red.While the US economy is growing at a "reasonably good pace" he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the US.Meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added.Speaking to the House Budget Committee he urged Congress to take action to cut the deficit, such as increasing taxes.As US growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit.
UK Coal said it was making "significant progress" in shaking up the business.The recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said.The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006.Total production costs were Â£1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just Â£1.18 per gigajoule.The company said these actions should "significantly uplift earnings".UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.
Japan's economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005.Japan's economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession.A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, although the Japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy.The Japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade.Gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004.The Tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year."The economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture, it is in a recovery stage," said Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Heizo Takenaka.The fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending, and follows similar falls in GDP in the two previous quarters.
US crude prices have soared to fresh four-month highs above $53 in the US as refinery problems propelled petrol prices to an all-time high.Meanwhile, oil production cartel Opec's recent announcement that it was now unlikely to cut production levels has also failed to calm fears on the market.Elsewhere, a refinery in Houston was closed due to mechanical problems, while on Tuesday production at BP's Texas City refinery was taken down for a short time.The jump followed a fire at Western Refining Company's refinery in Texas, which shut down petrol production.In the approach to Spring, the market becomes much more sensitive to problems with petrol production as dealers anticipate rising demand for fuel ahead of the holiday season.Ed Silliere, analyst at Energy Merchant, added: "Gasoline is up because of the refinery issues in Texas, which means there will be a scramble for product in the (US) Gulf Coast."
The economy has grown for six quarters but growth slowed dramatically in the last quarter amid weaker global demand.Japanese industrial output fell in October while unemployment rose, casting further doubt on the strength of the country's economic recovery.Analysts had been forecasting a 0.1% rise in month on month industrial output.According to figures from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the decline was led by a fall in demand for electronic parts for mobile phones and digital televisions.Although inventories fell 0.7% month on month, they were 36% higher than a year ago.Japanese government officials played down the latest data, arguing that domestic consumer demand was still resilient.
"With this new order and new pricing in place, Ryanair expects that unit operating costs (excluding fuel) will continue to fall each year for the next five years," he added.At the end of this year, Ryanair will have taken delivery of about 100 new planes, while the 70 new orders are due for delivery between 2008 and 2012.Budget airline Ryanair has placed an order for 70 Boeing 737-800 planes, in a deal valued at $4bn (Â£2.1bn) which should lead to 2,500 new Ryanair jobs.Ryanair said the new planes would help it to cut operating costs further.Ryanair chairman David Bonderman said that the 737-800 had "significantly reduced our unit operating costs and allowed us to reduce air fares each year for the last five years".
The plan is likely to give creditors of Parmalat Finanziaria shares worth about 5.7% of the debts they are owed.Creditors of Parmalat, the main operating company, are likely to see the percentage of debt they receive fall from 7.3% to 6.9%.As part of the re-listing on the Italian stock exchange, creditors' debts are expected to be converted into shares through two new share issues amounting to more than 2bn euros.In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Parmalat Finanziaria detailed administrators' latest plans for re-listing the shares of the group.Parmalat, the Italian dairy company which went bust after an accounting scandal, hopes to be back on the Italian stock exchange in July.
As well as increasing its dividend, Nestle plans to buy back shares worth 1bn Swiss francs ($861m; Â£451m).Nestle said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the US dollar, the disposal of businesses and challenging trading conditions in Europe all dented sales.Uncertainty remains over the future of Perrier, the iconic French mineral water owned by Nestle.Nestle is to raise its dividend by 11% after paying back some of its debt.Revenue dipped 1.4% to 86.7bn Swiss francs ($74.6bn; Â£39.1bn) in 2004 as sales of ice cream and mineral water were dampened by the wet summer.Elsewhere, Nestle said it had enjoyed an "exceptional" year in North America, outperforming the market in terms of sales growth.
Less than four years after the new Mini was launched, German car maker BMW has announced Â£100m of new investment.Last year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini.Initially, BMW said it would produce 100,000 Mini models a year at its vast Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again.When it was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than Â£10,000.These days, buyers will have to fork out almost Â£11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to Â£17,730.The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to Â£15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list.Last year, MG Rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge.The Mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars.BMW's Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for Â£10 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium."Our decision to produce a new Mini was not received well right away," said Norbert Reithofer, a member of the BMW management board.In 1999, when BMW still owned Rover, the Oxford factory was producing the award-winning Rover 75.Before Wednesday's announcement, BMW had invested some Â£280m in Mini production.
TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn.For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn.Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (Â£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues.Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters.Time Warner's fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts' expectations.
The dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.China's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive.Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months."I think the chairman's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time," said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York.The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US's yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments."He's taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next."
Yukos' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.State-owned Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by Russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against Yukos.The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft.But the company has said it intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk."The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets," said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case.
Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, said the results were "respectable" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by Â£106m or 47.3%.To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue."It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong," he said.Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's estimated annual surcharge revenues - Â£160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra Â£250m."For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated," BA chairman Martin Broughton said.Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers.BA's profits were still better than market expectation of Â£59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.
Pernod has reduced the debt it took on to fund the Seagram purchase to just 1.8bn euros, while Allied has improved the performance of its fast-food chains.Shares in UK drinks and food firm Allied Domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by France's Pernod Ricard.Pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics.In terms of market value, Pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than Allied Domecq, which has a capitalisation of Â£5.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros).Allied Domecq shares in London rose 4% by 1200 GMT, while Pernod shares in Paris slipped 1.2%.
On an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought.A common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.Revised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter.Japan's economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to September, figures show.
The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office.Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions.The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years."The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover.
At a conference on developing enterprise hosted by UK finance minister Gordon Brown on Friday, he said that he was in favour of floating exchange rates because they help countries cope with economic shocks.In London on Thursday ahead of the meeting, India's finance minister, lashed out at the restrictive trade policies of the G7 nations.Mr Chidambaram is attending the G7 meeting as part of the G20 group of nations, which account for two thirds of the world's population.China is expected to face renewed pressure to abandon its fixed exchange rate, which G7 nations, in particular the US, have blamed for a surge in cheap Chinese exports.Palaniappan Chidambaram, India's finance minister, argued that these organisations need to take into account the changing world order, given India and China's integration into the global economy.India, along with China, Brazil, South Africa and Russia, has been invited to take part in the G7 meeting taking place in London on Friday and Saturday.
In 2003, crop production totalled 11.49 million tonnes, the joint report from the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme said.The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) recommend that the food assistance is bought locally.Last year, a total of 965,000 tonnes of food assistance was needed to help seven million Ethiopians.The report calculated emergency food requirements for 2005 to be 387,500 tonnes.On top of that, 89,000 tonnes of fortified blended food and vegetable oil for "targeted supplementary food distributions for a survival programme for children under five and pregnant and lactating women" will be needed.
A US government claim accusing the country's biggest tobacco companies of covering up the effects of smoking has been thrown out by an appeal court.The tobacco companies deny that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public.In its case, the government claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction, targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns, lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary.Shares of tobacco companies closed higher after the ruling, with Altria rising 5% and Reynolds showing gains of 4.5%.
Ask Jeeves has become the third leading online search firm this week to thank a revival in internet advertising for improving fortunes.Its $17m profit for the quarter was dwarfed by the $204m announced by rival Google earlier in the week.During the same quarter, Yahoo earned $187m, again tipping a resurgence in online advertising.Neither Ask Jeeves nor Doubleclick thrilled investors with their profit news, however.Ask Jeeves, once among the best-known names on the web, is now a relatively modest player.
Indonesia's government has confirmed it is considering raising fuel prices by as much as 30%.Indonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices, but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down.Since President Yudhoyono's government came to power in October, it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies.President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor.Indonesia's previous government, led by President Megawati Sukarnoputri, also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003, but was forced to back down in the face of public protests.But critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help.
On Tuesday, the company's administrator, turnaround expert Enrico Bondi, sued Morgan Stanley, its former banker, to return 136m euros relating to a 2003 bond deal.The company has also sued former auditors and financial advisors for damages.That brought to 49 the number of banks that Mr Bondi has sued, a mass of legal action that could bring in as much as 3bn euros.And criminal cases against the company's former management are proceeding separately.Overall, the company's debt is close to 12bn euros, and is falling only slowly.
India's rupee has hit a five-year high after Standard & Poor's (S&P) raised the country's foreign currency rating.India's foreign currency rating is now one notch below investment grade, which starts at 'BBB-'.S&P, which rates borrowers' creditworthiness, lifted India's rating by one notch to 'BB+'.The currency has gained almost 1% in the past three sessions.
Struggling Japanese car maker Mitsubishi Motors has struck a deal to supply French car maker Peugeot with 30,000 sports utility vehicles (SUV).Mitsubishi Motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to March 2005.Last month, it signed a production agreement with Japanese rival Nissan Motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in Japan.In January, Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine months, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March 2005.Falling sales have left Mitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.As a result, the Japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts.
"Journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper, and maintaining the quality of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for our readers is vital," he said.The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.Telegraph executive Murdoch MacLennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months.The Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers are axing 90 journalist jobs - 17% of their editorial staff.The Telegraph Group says the cuts are needed to fund an Â£150m investment in new printing facilities.The National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike.The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size.Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages, or in some cases, have colour on every page.NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies.
The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year.Rapid tooling-up of China's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year.Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year.The curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices.In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a "hard landing" in the shape of an overbalancing economy.
In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.However, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to "extraordinary circumstances"."We reckon it's going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that's over Â£1bn a year loaded onto European passengers," Mr Clarke said.When this happens against a passenger's will, airlines will now have to offer compensation.All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday.The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights.Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.Air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.However, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket.The EC has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added.
"We need at least $20bn (Â£10.6bn) in investment and part of this has to come as foreign direct investment," said Mr Maran.Potential foreign investors will however need government approval before they increase their stake beyond 49%, Mr Maran said.Communications Minister Dayanidhi Maran said that there is a need to fund the fast-growing mobile market.India has raised the limit for foreign direct investment in telecoms companies from 49% to 74%.Investment bank Morgan Stanley has forecast that India's mobile market is likely to grow by about 40% a year until 2007.
The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year.Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers.In what Dimension Data calls an "alarming development", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving "agents not equipped to deal with customers".And if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job?There are "no big differences in wait time and call resolution" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world.Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.Suggestions that "outsourcing" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres' growing range of tasks.What are your experiences with call centres?However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year.The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents.As a result, call centres have a high "churn rate", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff.
But officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market.With unemployment stuck above 4 million for years, the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda.The seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller rise than expected, as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect."But growth of 0.1%... in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market.""Job creation measures probably prevented a stronger increase in the seasonally adjusted numbers.""The deterioration of the labour market does not come as a surprise," said Isabelle Kronawitter at Hypovereinsbank.
Leisure group Rank could unveil plans to demerge its film services unit and sell its media business, reports claim.Rank now aims to concentrate on its gaming, bars and hotels business, including extending its Hard Rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success.Since Mike Smith's appointment as chief executive in 1999, the group has focused on fewer businesses and embarked on a major cost-cutting programme which has seen it dispose of a number of businesses, including the Odeon cinema chain and the Pinewood studios.The move left the group with three core divisions: gaming, Hard Rock and Deluxe Films, which provides technical services to Hollywood studios.Speculation of a possible shake-up has mounted since Rank announced a study into a possible demerger in September.Analysts predict the firm is likely to report a slight drop in annual pre-tax profits to Â£170m from Â£194m last year.
Despite the apparent shortfall in annual economic growth, the good quarterly figures - a so-called "flash estimate" - mark a continuing trend of improving indicators for the health of the French economy.Also on Friday, France's industrial output for December was released, showing 0.7% growth.It leaves GDP up 2.3% for the full year, but short of the 2.5% which the French government had predicted.Service sector activity improved in January, hitting a seven-month high.But unemployment remains high at about 10%.
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003's imbalance of $496.5bn.The gap between US exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (Â£484bn) in 2004, latest figures show.However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to Â£56.4bn.The US consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush's economic policies.For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion.For example, they believe China's currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China's rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors.
The court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of Yugansk, which Yukos claims was illegally sold.Yukos had argued that a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore lives in Houston.A judge has dismissed an attempt by Russian oil giant Yukos to gain bankruptcy protection in the US.Texas Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of a US presence to establish US jurisdiction.Yukos claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection.Yukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling."The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia," Judge Clark said in her ruling.Yukos filed for Chapter 11 protection in Houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its Yugansk division by the Russian authorities.The US court's jurisdiction had been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft.Russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the US courts.
The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said.The NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open.The world's biggest carmaker General Motors (GM) is recalling nearly 200,000 vehicles in the US on safety grounds, according to federal regulators.News of the recall follows an announcement last month that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004.In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the largest recall involves 155,465 pickups, vans and sports utility vehicles (SUVs).
Mittal Steel, one of the world's largest steel producers, could cut up to 45,000 jobs over the next five years, its chief executive has said.Mittal Steel has operations in 14 countries.Mr Mittal told US investors that once the acquisition of International Steel Group was completed, the company would aim to reduce its workforce by between 7,000 and 8,000 annually.A Mittal Steel spokeman said that no decisions on job cuts have been made yet.Mittal Steel was formed last year when Mr Mittal's LNM Holdings merged with Dutch firm Ispat.However, Lakshmi Mittal has told investors the combined company will have to shed thousands of jobs.
Crude oil prices surged back above the $47 a barrel mark on Thursday after an energy market watchdog raised its forecasts for global demand.The US Department of Energy reported that crude stockpiles had fallen 1m barrels to 294.3m.The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned demand for Opec's crude in the first quarter would outstrip supply.The IEA raised its estimate of 2005 oil demand growth by 80,000 barrels a day to 84 million barrels a day.
US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said.But the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said.Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006.The soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world's major economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the OECD."The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005."If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters," Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC's World Business Report.A dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said.
The Vestey Group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities.Officials in Cojedes state said on Friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the Vestey Group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers.Venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a British company as part of President Chavez's agrarian reform programme.Last month, the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40,000.The firm, whose Agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in Venezuela, insisted that it had complied fully with Venezuelan law.Under President Chavez, the Venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state's involvement in the country's economy.The authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had "nothing to fear".The Vestey Group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure.
Irish shares have risen to a record high, with investors persuaded to buy into the market by low inflation and strong growth forecasts."Buoyant economic conditions are set to continue in Ireland over the next few years and Irish equities continue to offer quality growth at a reasonable valuation."Ireland's economic 'miracle' is enjoying a second wind, with 5% growth forecast for 2005 and 2006.The ISEQ index of leading shares closed up 23 points to 6661.89 on Thursday, fuelled by strong growth in banking and financial stocks.The economy is set for strong growth in 2005 while interest rates remain low.Analysts said that economic conditions were benign and Irish shares were still trading at a discount to other European markets.Allied Irish Banks, Ireland's biggest company by capitalisation, touched a five year peak while Bank of Ireland shares rose to their highest level since August 2002.
Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Financial has withdrawn its takeover offer for rival bank UFJ Holdings, enabling the latter to merge with Mitsubishi Tokyo.Sumitomo, Japan's third-largest bank, tabled a higher offer for UFJ than its rival, valuing the company at $35bn.However, UFJ's management was known to prefer the offer from Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group (MTFG), Japan's second-largest bank.UFJ Holdings, Japan's fourth-largest bank, has been at the centre of a fierce bid battle over the last year.Sumitomo bosses told counterparts at UFJ of its decision on Friday, clearing the way for it to conclude a 3 trillion yen ($29bn) deal with Mitsubishi.Mitsubishi's takeover of UFJ - which will be Japan's largest-ever takeover deal - will still have to be approved by shareholders of the two firms.
A total of 24.2 trillion pesos ($10.2bn; Â£5.5bn) is earmarked for subsidies for the poor, the government department for planning said.Sound distribution of the cash could cut poverty levels to 36% from 53%, the government believes.Half of the money put aside by the Colombian government to help the country's poor is benefiting people who do not need it, a study has found."Resources are more than enough to reduce poverty and there is no need for more tax reforms but a better distribution," deputy planning director Jose Leibovich said.
But Rover told BBC News that reports of job cuts were "speculation".SAIC was unavailable for comment on the job cuts when contacted by BBC News.Rover and SAIC signed a technology-sharing agreement in August.Some 2,000 jobs at MG Rover's Midlands plant may be cut if investment in the firm by a Chinese car maker goes ahead, the Financial Times has reported.SAIC says none of its money will be paid to the four owners of Rover, who have been accused by unions of awarding themselves exorbitant salaries, the FT reports.Meanwhile, according to Chinese state press reports, small state-owned carmaker Nanjing Auto is in negotiations with Rover and SAIC to take a 20% stake in the joint venture.
WPP in recent years has also bought firms such as Ogilvy & Mather and Cordiant Communications.UK advertising giant WPP has posted larger-than-expected annual profits and predicted that it will outperform the market in 2005.Pre-tax profits rose 15% from a year ago to reach Â£546m ($1.04bn), ahead of average analysts' forecasts of Â£532m.During the year WPP bought US rival Grey Global, creating a giant big enough to rival sector leader Omnicom.The long-term outlook looks "very favourable" because of media and technology developments and the strength of the US economy, WPP said.
Many foreign firms had protested that the SEC was imposing an unfair burden.The SEC said it had taken into consideration the fact that foreign companies were already working to meet more onerous financial reporting rules in their home countries.Section 404 of the Sox Act, as the legislation is nicknamed, calls for all firms to certify that their financial reporting is in line with US rules.Foreign firms have been given an extra year to meet tough new corporate governance regulations imposed by the US stock market watchdog.Big US firms already have to meet the requirements, but smaller ones and foreign-based firms which list their shares on US stock markets originally had until the middle of this year.The European Union, in particular, was imposing new international financial reporting standards in 2005, it noted.
A year ago, debt was more than 11bn euros higher.This was more than expected and helped to bring debt down to 35.8bn euros.Sales rose 2.8% to 14.96bn euros.Sales of stakes in firms including Russia's OAO Mobile Telesystems raised 1.17bn euros.
Yantai State Asset Management Bureau - a government agency in the north-eastern city of Yantai - owns 55% of Changyu.The consumption of wine in China is still low, at just 0.22 litres per capita, said the US Agriculture Department.Italy's Illva Saronno has agreed to buy 33% of Changyu, the largest wine maker in China.Chinese wine sales are growing, the US Agriculture Department said, with wine sales in 2003 up 25% at 61.1bn yuan.The Italian liqueur maker will acquire the shares from the Yantai State Asset Management Bureau.
But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies.Mr Tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies.There was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable.Yoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team.His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals.One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data."I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain," Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987.He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.
UK sportswear firm Umbro has posted a 222% rise in annual profit after sales of replica England football kits were boosted by the Euro 2004 tournament.Umbro, which recently lost sponsorship deals with Chelsea and Celtic, said on Thursday it had signed a new four-year agreement with Scottish club Rangers.In January, Umbro announced its sponsorship agreement with Chelsea, which gave Umbro the lucrative right to make replica shirts, would end in 2006, five years earlier than expected.The firm, reporting its first annual results since listing on the London Stock Exchange in June, said the UK market had seen sales growth of 8% last year.Chief executive Peter McGuigan said the firm plans to grow sales both in the UK and internationally.
The EFF, representing the reporters, has asked California's Superior court to stop Apple pursuing the sources.The case began in December 2004 when Apple asked a local Californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites AppleInsider.com and PowerPage.org.Civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has joined a legal fight between three US online journalists and Apple.Apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named Asteroid and has asked the journalists' e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that."Rather than confronting the issue of reporter's privilege head-on, Apple is going to the journalist's ISPs for his e-mails," said EFF lawyer Kurt Opsahl.The EFF has gained some powerful allies in its legal battle with Apple, including Professor Tom Goldstein, former dean of the Journalism School at the University of California and Dan Gillmor, a well-known Silicon Valley journalist.
One in 10 adult Americans - equivalent to 22 million people - owns an MP3 player, according to a survey.A study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that MP3 players are the gadget of choice among affluent young Americans.The survey did not interview teenagers but it is likely that millions of under-18s also have MP3 players.MP3 players are still the gadget of choice for younger adults.Of the 22 million Americans who own MP3 players, 59% are men compared to 41% of women."IPods and MP3 players are becoming a mainstream technology for consumers" said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project.The American love affair with digital music players has been made possible as more and more homes get broadband.
A proposed European law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the European Commission (EC) despite requests by MEPs.But that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive.Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US.If the European Council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the European Parliament.Most EU legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the Council of Ministers before it becomes law.Some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions, while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms The EC says the Council of Ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last May but said it would review "all aspects of the directive".
Spooks Interactive took the best interactive TV prize.It collected six Baftas, including best game and best online game.The BBC collected three awards, including best online entertainment for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Adventure Game.Awards were given out in 12 different categories, including interactive TV, film, music, design, as well as technical and social innovation, at a London ceremony.The awards have been running since 1997, but in 2002 the British Academy of Film and Television decided to split them into separate games and interactive ceremonies.The BBC and the National Theatre have led the field at this year's Interactive Bafta awards.The National Theatre's Stagework website picked up the prize for best learning as well as top factual site.The annual awards recognise the best in digital media.
A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system, said Mr Dyer.But the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake.As the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to Paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, Mr Dyer said.The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'.A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned.Registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF.So-called ASCII codes are used to represent European languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called Unicode is used.But the UK Internet Forum (UKIF) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily.The Internationalised Domain Names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the Internet Electronic Task Force.
Owning all 10 gadgets will set the gadget lover back Â£7,455.Portable gadgets dominate the list, including Sharp's 902 3G mobile phone, the Pentax Optio SV digital camera and Samsung's Yepp YH-999 video jukebox."What this year's Essentials shows is that gadgets are now cheaper, sexier and more indispensable than ever.That is Â£1,000 cheaper than last year's list due to falling manufacturing costs making gadgets more affordable.Next year will see a new set of technologies capturing the imaginations of gadget lovers, Stuff predicts.Sony's Playstation Portable is the top gadget for 2005, according to a round-up of ultimate gizmos compiled by Stuff Magazine.
Texas, which makes computer chips for more than half the world's mobile phones, said it was keen to make multimedia functions like video and gaming more affordable.Texas is keen to cash in on the third generation (3G) of mobile technology, which offers high-speed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions.A further recent survey said that only 4% of mobile owners were thinking of upgrading to 3G phones.The specially-designed chip, developed by Texas Instruments, could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of 3D gaming and 30-frame-a-second video.Competition to get people using 3G mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the UK's operators have now launched third generation networks.A mobile phone chip which combines a modem and a computer processor on one bit of silicon instead of two could make phones cheaper and more powerful.The chip also uses much less power than conventional chips, said Texas, which means less strain on mobile battery life.More than 50 million people own a mobile in the UK, but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more.
Laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people.Chinese authorities closed 12,575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004, the country's government said.China has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people.This is not the first time that the Chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines.The hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated.According to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally.In August 2004 Chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn.Net cafes are hugely popular in China because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have PCs in their homes.
The other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink - but as the elections in Afghanistan showed, improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems.The use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills.The use of "invisible" ink is not without its own problems.The use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections - the German Embassy, the Soros Foundation and the Kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes.The author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink.The use of ink has been controversial - especially among groups perceived to be pro-government.In an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as "an island of democracy", the Kyrgyz President, Askar Akaev, pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming Parliamentary and Presidential elections.At the entrance to each polling station, one election official will scan voter's fingers with UV lamp before allowing them to enter, and every voter will have his/her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot.The ink is sprayed on a person's left thumb.If the ink shows under the UV light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station.The actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated.The Kyrgyz Republic, a small, mountainous state of the former Soviet republic, is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country's elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.This type of ink has been used in many elections in the world, in countries as varied as Serbia, South Africa, Indonesia and Turkey.
Microsoft is investigating a trojan program that attempts to switch off the firm's anti-spyware software.Microsoft said it did not believe the program was widespread and recommended users to use an anti-virus program.Stephen Toulouse, a security manager at Microsoft, said the malicious program was called Bankash-A Trojan and was being sent as an e-mail attachment.Microsoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software.
"We are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology," said Frank Stone, head of the BT's business sector programmes.The art world is "fantastically rich", said Mr Stone, with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like BT want to get in with them.The partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net, according to Mr Stone.The idea, says BT, is to shape a "21st Century model" which will help cement the art, technology, and business worlds together.It is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries, or more patent ideas for tech companies.Technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential, not least because it gives people something to do with their technology.BT's own engine, Tara (Total Abstract Rendering Architecture) has been in development since 2001 and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners.But collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new, and many keen coders, designers, games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself.The hi-tech and the arts worlds have for some time danced around each other and offered creative and technical help when required.They have both been created using the telco's technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm, including a sophisticated graphics rendering program.But that dance is growing more intimate as hi-tech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration.UK telco BT is serious about the idea and has launched its Connected World initiative.Between 1997 and 2002, the creative industry brought Â£21 billion to London alone.He looks after several "centres of excellence" which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations, one of which is focused on creative industries.In their previous works they used the Quake game graphics engine.
He said one laptop per child could be " very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood".He said the child could use the laptop like a text book.Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious.That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away."Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (Â£53).The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops."Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months."
The Agricultural Information Project for Farmers of the Chancay-Huaral Valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation, enabling them to coordinate their actions.One of the key elements of the project is the Agricultural Information System, with its flagship huaral.org website.The information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region, and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of Peru and even around the world.A network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology, is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in Peru."Throughout the last three years, the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them," said Mr Saldarriaga.The Board of Irrigation Users which runs the computer centres, aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years, through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes.The system also helps the inhabitants of the Chancay-Huaral Valley to organise their vital irrigation systems."The plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system," said Carlos Saldarriaga, technical coordinator at Cepes.It is a precious element in Peru's coastal areas, because it is so scarce, and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it," Mr Saldarriaga told the BBC News website.Now, with the wireless network, Cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.The network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in September.The non-government organisation, Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies) led the $200,000 project, also backed by local institutions, the Education and Agriculture ministries, and European development organisations.
Microsoft has warned PC users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in Windows programs.One of the critical patches Microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some IE flaws.In its monthly security bulletin, it flagged up eight "critical" security holes which could leave PCs open to attack if left unpatched.Often, when a critical flaw is announced, spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched.The most important ones are those which are classed as "critical".The number of holes considered "critical" is more than usual.
Anti-virus firm Sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the Zafi virus.The Zafi.D virus translates the Christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail.The virus' subject line says "Merry Christmas" and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to.On infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the PC to hand over control to the writer of the virus.Security firms are warning about a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card.The original Zafi virus appeared in April this year.
The Apple Powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time, by US magazine Mobile PC.The most popular gadget of the moment, the Apple iPod, is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13.The first mobile PC was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile PC?!Surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone?The magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two.A laptop computer is not a gadget!It has to be the mobile phone.The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10, which also includes the first flash mp3 player (Diamound Multimedia), as well as the first "successful" digital camera (Casio QV-10) and mobile phone (Motorola Startac).The Sinclair Executive was the world's first pocket calculator.There will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices.The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980.I'd have put the mobile phone high up the list.The oldest "gadget" in the top 100 is the abacus, which the magazine dates at 190 A.D., and put in 60th place.The 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first "lightweight" portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs.The ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever.By far the most useful gadget."In the end, we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget," it concluded.The magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a "self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own, not a subset of another device".From outside the modern age, the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget, without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly.Karl Elsener's knife, the Swiss Army Knife from 1891, is at number 20 in the list.Case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first, I think).It's out of date - not much of a "gadget".Yes, the Apple laptop and Sony Walkman are classic gadgets.A true gadget, it could be carried around and shown off.No other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time.Other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position), the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 (28th position).Also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule.It's obviously the mobile phone or remote control, and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that."In general we included only items that were potentially mobile," said the magazine.It has revolutionalised communication, which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop.Gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone (23rd), the Nintendo GameBoy (25th), and the Pulsar quartz digital watch (36th).How did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)?All top 10 are electronic toys, so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anyhting else.But to call the sextant and the marine chronometer 'gadgets' and rank them as less important than a TV remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective.An interesting list.Psion Organiser series 3, should be up there.The Psion series 3c!The first most practical way to carry all your info around...
If a user clicks the AutoLink feature in the Google toolbar then a webpage with a book's unique ISBN number would link directly to Amazon's website.Some users said AutoLink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any "click through" to a commercial site.Google said none of the companies which received AutoLinks had paid for the service."But as an end user I would want to know - 'Can I choose to use this service?, 'How much is Google being paid?In a statement Google said the feature was still only in beta, ie trial, stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users.Search engine firm Google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites.It said: "The user can choose never to click on the AutoLink button, and web pages she views will never be modified.Mr Doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using AutoLink or "tricked into using the service"."In addition, the user can choose to disable the AutoLink feature entirely at any time."The AutoLink feature comes with Google's latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to Amazon.com if it finds a book's ISBN number on the site.
IBM said it had taken the step in response to greater customer demand for the open source software.Linux and the open source software movement are based on the premise that developers should be free to tinker with the core components of software programs.IBM is spending $100m (Â£52m) over the next three years beefing up its commitment to Linux software.IBM said the money will fund a variety of technical, research and marketing initiatives to boost Linux use.The cash injection will be used to help its customers use Linux on every type of device from handheld computers and phones right up to powerful servers.
Web tracking company Envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the UK and that downloads of TV programmes had increased by 150% in the last year.A typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100,000 people globally, said the report, and an estimated 20,000 of those were from within the UK."It's now as easy to download a pirate TV show as it is to programme a VCR," said Ben Coppin from Envisional.More people with high-speed broadband connections in the UK also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly.Exact figures are difficult to pin down, but it is thought that about 80,000 to 100,000 people in the UK download TV programmes.But in some cases, said the report, people were able to watch the new episodes in Britain before US audiences on the west coast of the country.There are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store TV programmes for viewers, effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer.The Envisional reports said that the TV industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows.Many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content, like TV programmes.It let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired.British TV viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading US shows from the net, according to research.Fans of many popular US TV programmes, like 24, usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the UK.
The UK Film Council has awarded a contract worth Â£11.5m to Arts Alliance Digital Cinema (AADC), who will set up the network of up to 250 screens.The world's first digital cinema network will be established in the UK over the next 18 months."Although a genuine variety of films is available in central London and a few other metropolitan areas, the choice for many outside these areas remains limited, and the Digital Screen Network will improve access for audiences across the UK," Digital prints costs less than a traditional 35mm print - giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films, said Ms Deans.Most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images."With digital prints, every cinema will have its own copy.""A cinema will often book a 35mm print in for two weeks - even if the film is a roaring success they cannot hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema.The UK digital network will be the first to employ 2k projectors - which are capable of showing films at resolutions of 2048 * 1080 pixels.AADC will oversee the selection of cinemas across the UK which will use the digital equipment."Distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer.""In the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that.
The European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.To become law both the European Parliament and a qualified majority of EU states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill.During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped.Politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law.Other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the American system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software.He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents.
Microsoft has said it will replace more than 14 million power cables for its Xbox consoles due to safety concerns.Microsoft said it had received 30 reports of minor injury or property damage due to faulty cables.Microsoft said customers would get replacement cords within two to four weeks from the time of order.In a statement, it added: "In almost all instances, any damage caused by these failures was contained within the console itself or limited to the tip of the power cord at the back of the console."In 23 cases, customers reported smoke damage, or minor damage to a carpet or entertainment centre.The firm said fewer than one in 10,000 consoles had experienced component failures.
Mr Goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of Britain's mobile mountain made it overseas."This is the only way I can afford to have a phone," she said.Older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model.Re-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment, it has social benefits too.Reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of Romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets."It's quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around," said Mr Goodman.Research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide.Georgeta Minciu, a Romanian part-time cleaner, said: "Normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages.The Forum for the Future report took an in-depth look at Romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular.The report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the UK.
"If you have a blog, the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except 'Free Mojtaba and Arash Day'," said Mr Hopkins.The month-old Committee to Protect Bloggers' is asking those with blogs to dedicate their sites on 22 February to the "Free Mojtaba and Arash Day".Mr Hopkins said that the blogsphere - which is doubling every five months - was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog.The Committee to Protect Bloggers was started by US blogger Curt Hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger Ellen Simonetti as a deputy director.People think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view," said Mr Hopkins.But the way these issues get tested is through the courts which, said Mr Hopkins, "is part of the whole messy conversation."The question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently.Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily."If you haven't already got bloggers in your company, you will have them tomorrow - and if you don't have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one.The Committee has deemed Tuesday "Free Mojtaba and Arash Day" as part of its first campaign.The global web blog community is being called into action to lend support to two imprisoned Iranian bloggers.The group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take, including writing to local Iranian embassies.It is calling on the blogsphere - the name for the worldwide community of bloggers - to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of Mojtaba and Arash as well as other "cyber-dissidents".She has since started the International Bloggers' Bill of Rights, a global petition to protect bloggers at work.The Committee, although only a month old, aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future, and will operate as a non-for-profit organisation.
Sony, IBM and Toshiba, who have been working on the Cell processor for three years, will unveil the chip at a technology conference.It is being designed for use in graphics workstations, the new PlayStation console, and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip.Details of the chip designed to power Sony's PlayStation 3 console will be released in San Francisco on Monday.Sony has said the Cell processor could be used to bridge the gap between movies and video games.IBM said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the US.The chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media.The chip is reported to be up to 10 times faster than current processors.Details of the chip will be released at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco.
While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances.Dr Paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses.Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material.Scientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light.But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light."It creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light," he said.Currently, says Dr Paniccia, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it.This is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables.
Microsoft is working on a new version of its Internet Explorer web browser.The decision to make Internet Explorer 7 is widely seen as a U-turn because, before now, Microsoft said it had no need to update the browser.In particular the Firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in November 2004.Microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals.Typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the Windows operating system.A new version of IE was widely expected to debut with the next version of Windows, codenamed Longhorn, which is due to appear in 2006.Test versions of the new program, called IE 7, are due to be released by the summer.The current version of Internet Explorer is four years old, and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as Firefox and Opera.In a bid to shore up the poor security in IE 6, Microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware.Earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the IE browser.
Every month the prices drop, and more and more people are trying to switch," he said."We discovered a huge variety of problems, but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier," said Tim Danton, editor of PC Pro.A third of the 2,000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks Tim Danton, editor of PC Pro Magazine.A survey conducted by PC Pro Magazine has revealed that many Britons are unhappy with their internet service.With prices set to drop even further in coming months Mr Danton advises everyone to shop around carefully.The survey found that BT and Tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription.It is particularly bad news for BT, the UK's biggest internet supplier, with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining.
Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity.Sun Grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by Sun.The Sun Grid relies on Solaris, the operating system owned by Sun.Some of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5,000 processors each, Sun said.Sun Microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour.So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software.
The laser links also take far less time to set up and get working, said Mr Sridharan.In 12 months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than 700 locations.The laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps (2,000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection) but Tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 1-2mbps.Tata Teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers' offices and its own core network.The Lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network.An Indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country.The laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections."In this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task," said Mr R. Sridharan, vice president of networks at Tata.In some locations, he said, permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get.
People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions.She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game."We cannot give people any control over how the images are used.Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performer's fee for the use of their image.Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.The Canada-based company says it was looking for "a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters".
Sony has billed the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan.Sony has said it wanted to launch the PSP in Europe at roughly the same time as the US, but gamers will now fear that the launch has been put back.Nintendo has said it will release the DS in Europe from 11 March.It launched its DS handheld in Japan and the US last year and has sold 2.8 million units.
Mr Hogan said 90% of the junk mail filtered by Symantec subsidiary Brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses.But the novel worm spotted recently by Spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place.As blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical, Spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped.Spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real e-mail messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent.While the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too.In this way the junk mail gets a net address that looks legitimate.For instance, said Mr Hogan, filtering out e-mail messages that contain a web link can stop about 75% of spam.Anti-spam group Spamhaus is warning about a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail.
She said the spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered.She said that DEC hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible.The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster.Patricia Sanders, spokeswoman for the Disaster Emergency Committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the Computer Crime Unit at Scotland Yard to help get it shut down.Ms Sanders said DEC had contacted US net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web.DEC was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation.None of the e-mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records.All attempts by the BBC News website to contact the people behind the site have failed.BT and DEC's hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down, she said.The web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate.
BBC Sport unveils its new analysis tool Piero at the Wales v England rugby union match on Saturday.BBC Sport is the first client to start using the system.But BBC Sport's new tool Piero could end discussions in minutes.The more cameras using Piero, the better the detail possible out the other end when the data is turned into 3D models.The technology has been created by BBC Research and Development for BBC Broadcast and BBC Outside Broadcasts.BBC Broadcast hopes the technology can be sold to third parties interested in using it a number of different ways - from sport broadcasting to entertainment and game shows."In order to keep audiences growing and growing... we need to work closely with people who create technology and innovation to bring sport to life," said Andrew Thompson, the BBC's head of development, new media and sports news.Viewers will be able to see precisely how the ball was thrown and by whom, giving a greater depth to the growing wealth of analysis available during sports broadcasts."It allows us to tell the story of a passage of play, tracking individual players across the field, looking at tactics," said Andy Townsend, from BBC Broadcast.
In a panel discussion at a Linux summit in California Mr Torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement.There are between 150,000 and 300,000 registered software patents in the US and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted."The industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software," "We think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents, copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries, and not be forced into using one or the other," she added."As far as Intellect is concerned, open source and patents have co-existed for many years without problems," said spokeswoman Jill Sutherland.The war of words between Microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as Linux founder Linus Torvalds led an attack on software patents.Some panel members are worried that Microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future.
The Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the Commission should re-submit the Computer Implemented Inventions Directive after MEPs failed to back it.Opponents of the draft directive welcomed the decision and said a new first reading of the proposals would give the EU a chance to have fuller debates about its implications in all member states.Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US.It has had vocal critics who say it could favour large over small firms and impact open-source software innovation.The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, "computer implemented invention".Supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions.
More people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats, said security firm RSA, which carried out the poll.The method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time.Activcard is just one of the many companies, like RSA Security, which has been trying to come up with just that.Almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people."By the time they go back [to use the information], the code has expired, so they can't prove who they are," according to Mr Ash.Trust in online security is falling as a result.It means that in a typical security attack, explains Mr Ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode.In a separate survey by RSA, 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems.One of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual's identity.The survey of more than 1,000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online.Several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget.For many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard."The PDA or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around," he said.It combines that with usual usernames and passwords, as well as other security questions.Ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too, as well as the individual, and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud, he said.The code is validated by the bank's systems, matching the information they expect with the customer's unique key.He added: "The challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability."It is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack," said Mr Ash."You take the card, put it in the reader, enter your pin number, and a code is given.
The system is not available commercially yet, but Motorola, the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now.Using technology from Lucent, it will offer data speeds of 3.6Mbps from next summer on its Isle of Man 3G network, and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4Mbps.At 3GSM, Siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data.But some mobile operators are opting for a technology called Evolution, Data Optimised (EV-DO).The speeds offered by3G mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3G licences.The German company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3G networks.Siemens' plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today, but Christoph Caselitz, president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that: "By the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015, the need for transmission capacities for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10."Siemens - in collaboration with the Fraunhofer German-Sino Lab for Mobile Communications and the Institute for Applied Radio System Technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae, instead of the usual one.Motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9Mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3G cell using a single HSDPA device.Fast 3G networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service, says the Global Mobile Suppliers Association."High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) - sometimes called Super 3G - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips," according to a report published by UK-based research consultancy Analysys.US operator Sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3G network at the end of last year.MMO2, the UK-based operator with services in the UK, Ireland and Germany, has opted for technology based on the High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) standard.
"The digital divide is rapidly closing," the World Bank report said."Developing countries are catching up with the rich world in terms of access [to mobile networks]," the report said.But a spokesman for the UN's World Summit on the Information Society said the digital divide remained very real.The "digital divide" between rich and poor nations is narrowing fast, according to a World Bank report."People in the developing world are getting more access at an incredible rate - far faster than... in the past," said the report.A spokesman for the World Summit for the Information Society (WSIS), which is meeting this week in Geneva, told the BBC News website: "The digital divide is very much real and needs to be addressed."The fund is voluntary and will help finance local community-based projects," said the WSIS spokesman.
A rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems is being launched by the UK government.The NISCC spokesman said the site and alerting service would stay in existence for as long as there were security bugs on home computers and other gadgets.Full-time staff are being employed to comb through the many hundreds of alerts issued each year by computer security firms to spot which ones have the potential to catch out a large number of people Between alerts the service will occasionally send messages giving people advice about safe ways to use their computers and phones.The National Alerting Service for the Netherlands (aka De Waarschuwingsdienst) and the US National Cyber Alerting Service also tell citizens of serious security threats.Those signing up will only be told about the most serious security threats that have the potential to affect millions of people.Alerts tell people how the threats affect them and what they can do to avoid trouble and protect themselves.The alerts will tell people how to go about getting hold of patches from security firms.Warnings about security problems will tell people what the problem is, how it affects them and what they can do to avoid trouble."IT Safe will take our technical expertise and use it to help home users understand the risks and keep their computer systems, mobile phones and a range of related consumer electronic items, safe," said Roger Cumming, director of the National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre (NISCC).The NISCC, which is running the service, also stressed that those signing up would still need to use anti-virus software, firewalls, and software updates to stay secure.
Mr Sigarchi was sentenced one day after an online campaign highlighted his case in a day of action in defence of bloggers around the world.His sentence, criticised by human rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders, comes a day after an online "day of action" to secure his release.A spokesman for Reporters Without Borders, which tracks press freedom across the globe, described Mr Sigarchi's sentence as "harsh" and called on Iranian President Mohammed Khatami to work to secure his immediate release.Iranian authorities have arrested about 20 online journalists during the current crackdown.Mr Sigarchi, who also edits a newspaper in northern Iran, was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the Gilan area.In the days before his arrest Mr Sigarchi gave interviews to the BBC Persian Service and the US-funded Radio Farda.Curt Hopkins said Mr Sigarchi's sentence would not dent the resolve of bloggers joining the campaign to help highlight the case.Around 10,000 people visited the campaign's website during the day.
Microsoft is investigating a trojan program that attempts to switch off the firm's anti-spyware software.Microsoft said it did not believe the program was widespread and recommended users to use an anti-virus program.Stephen Toulouse, a security manager at Microsoft, said the malicious program was called Bankash-A Trojan and was being sent as an e-mail attachment.Microsoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software.
A US woman is suing Hewlett Packard (HP), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date.The cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in Europe for the last 18 months.The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the US who has purchased an HP inkjet printer since February 2001.The price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as Â£34 but it could cost up to Â£1,700 in running costs over an 18-month period due to cartridge, a study by Computeractive Magazine revealed last year.HP ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change.
It has filed 100 lawsuits against operators of BitTorrent server sites since December.In BitTorrent systems, server sites do not host the files being shared.It is the latest network which uses the peer-to-peer system called BitTorrent to be hit by the MPAA.But it is now targeting the operators of BitTorrent networks themselves.As well as filing an unspecified number of file suits across the US, the MPAA said it had given operators that host eDonkey servers "take down" notices.The MPAA began its legal campaign against operators of similar networks across four continents in December.The action came after the operators of LokiTorrent agreed a settlement with the MPAA.The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) also said it had succeeded in getting a network called LokiTorrent closed down.
An attachment in the e-mail contains the virus, the FBI said.The US Federal Bureau of Investigation is warning that a computer virus is being spread via e-mails that purport to be from the FBI."Recipients of this or similar solicitations should know that the FBI does not engage in the practice of sending unsolicited e-mails to the public in this manner," the FBI said in a statement.But rather than being a questionnaire, the attachment contains a virus that infects the recipient's computer, according to the agency.Users are warned never to open attachment from unsolicited e-mails or from people they do not know.
The IFPI industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth.The company, which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market, also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped.Its latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an iPod mini model which can hold 6GB compared to a previous 4GB.One in 10 US adults - 22 million people - now owns a digital music player of some sort.The original iPod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design.Apple has expanded its iPod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players.A 30GB version has also been added to the iPod Photo family.Analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players.Mr McGuire said Apple was ensuring it kept a foot in the mobile music door with its recent deal with Motorola to produce a version of iTunes for Motorola phones.According to Mr McGuire, research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music, which they can do with high-capacity storage devices, like iPods and Creative Zens.Digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young Americans, according to recent research by the Pew Internet and American Life Project.
T-Mobile has launched its latest "pocket office" third-generation (3G) device which also has built-in wi-fi - high-speed wireless net access.Mr Obermann added that the mobile industry in general was still growing, with many more opportunities for more services which would bear fruit for mobile companies in future.Reflecting the growing need to be connected outside the office, it announced it would introduce a flat-fee Â£20 ($38) a month wi-fi tariff for people in the UK using its wi-fi hotspots.It also announced it was installing high-speed wi-fi on certain train services, such as the UK's London to Brighton service, to provide commuters a fast net connection too.In response to demand, T-Mobile also said it would be adding the latest phone-shaped Blackberry to its mobile range.He said this was something other similar in-train wi-fi services, such as that offered on GNER trains, did not offer yet.It said it would nearly double the number of its hotspots - places where wi-fi access is available - globally from 12,300 to 20,000.Wi-fi access points will be connected to a Wimax wireless network - faster than wi-fi - running alongside the train tracks.Unlike other devices where the user has to check which high-speed network is available to transfer data, the device selects the fastest one itself.
Skype allows people to make free PC-based calls to other Skype users.Users will need a Skype account - downloadable for free - and they will then be able to make net calls via wi-fi without paying for net access.Its paid service - dubbed Skype Out - has so far attracted 940,000 users.Wireless provider Broadreach and net telephony firm Skype are rolling out a service at 350 hotspots around the UK this week.It plans to add more paid services with forthcoming launches of video conferencing, voice mail and Skype In, a service which would allow users to receive phone calls from landlines and mobiles.
Macrovision says its new RipGuard technology will thwart most, but not all, of the current DVD ripping (copying) programs used to pirate DVDs.Macrovision said the new technology will work in "nearly all" current DVD players when applied to the discs, but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with RipGuard.Macrovision said RipGuard would also prevent against "rent, rip and return" - where people would rent a DVD, copy it and then return the original.DVDs will be harder to copy thanks to new anti-piracy measures devised by copy protection firm Macrovision."RipGuard is designed to... reduce DVD ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer," said the firm.RipGuard is expected to be rolled out on DVDs from the middle of 2005, the company said.
